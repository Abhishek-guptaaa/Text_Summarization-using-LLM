# Text_Summarization-using-LLM

The goal of this project is to build an efficient text summarizer using a Large Language Model (LLM) powered by the Groq API. Text summarization is a valuable task in natural language processing (NLP) that condenses long pieces of text into shorter versions while retaining the essential information.
